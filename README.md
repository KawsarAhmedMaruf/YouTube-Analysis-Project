The YouTube Analysis project utilizes the YouTube API and data obtained using an API key to perform an analysis on four different YouTube channels: Simplilearn, StatQuest with Josh Starmer, FreeCodeCamp.org, and Great Learning. The project aims to compare and analyze video performance across these channels based on various metrics such as view count, like count, and comment count.

To start the analysis, the project collects data from each channel using the YouTube API and saves it as CSV files. This data includes information such as the video title, video ID, view count, like count, and comment count.

Next, the project filters the data to focus on videos that meet specific criteria for each channel. For example, for Simplilearn, videos with a like count of at least 500 and a comment count of at least 100 are considered. Similarly, similar filters are applied to the other channels.

The project then identifies the top 10 videos with the highest view count for each channel. These top-performing videos are a representation of the channel's most popular and successful content.

Upon analyzing the top-performing videos, it is observed that FreeCodeCamp.org stands out as the highest-performing channel compared to the others. FreeCodeCamp.org has achieved remarkable success with significantly higher view counts, like counts, and comment counts for its videos.

Overall, this project provides a comprehensive analysis of these YouTube channels, allowing users to understand and compare the performance and success of videos based on various metrics.
